The reason is that the number might easily be scewed when there are multiple sources for which one reports the statistic on a yearly basis and the other reports it for instance every 4 years. In simpler situations where there is not multiple sources per statistic, this number should be the same as Entries.</li>\n",
    "<li> Unlike the excel file, I would not include args/enums in the analysis yet for simplicity. Although this is potentially very interesting, these vary a lot across statistics and a I think I will be quite some further work to design and obtain a good overview for these. Also an analysis of these will possibly be easier in the near future when some of the enhancement issues have been implemented.</li>\n",
