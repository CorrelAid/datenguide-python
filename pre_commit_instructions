-install requirements_dev.txt
-run "pre-commit install" in the root directory
-run "pre-commit run" in the root directory
    This should fetch all the repositories for pre-commit so if it runs
    through pre-commit installation works correctly. Other than that this
    command will skip all steps as no files are specified.
-optionally run " pre-commit run --all-files" to actually run the tools on the files
    Tools will also run now on every "git commit"
